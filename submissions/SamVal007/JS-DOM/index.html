        <p>Ronald Antonio O'Sullivan OBE (born 5 December 1975) is an English professional snooker player from Essex. As
          a six-time (and reigning) world champion, a record seven-time Masters champion, and a record seven-time UK
          champion, he is the most successful player in the history of snooker's Triple Crown Series, with a record 20
          titles. He also holds the record for the most ranking titles in professional snooker, with 37. His career
          prize money of over £11.7 million is the most by any player in snooker history.
        </p>
        <p>
          A noted snooker prodigy from an early age, O'Sullivan made his first competitive century break at age 10, won
          the British Under-16 Championship at age 13, achieved his first competitive maximum break at age 15, and won
          the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship before turning professional in 1992, aged 16. He won his first
          ranking title at the 1993 UK Championship aged 17 years and 358 days, making him the youngest player ever to
          win a professional ranking event, a record he still holds. He is also the youngest player ever to win the
          Masters, which he first achieved in 1995, aged 19 years and 69 days. O'Sullivan is now also noted for his
          longevity in the sport, having competed in a record 28 consecutive World Championships at the Crucible between
          1993 and 2020. Winning the 2020 World Championship aged 44 years and 254 days made him the second-oldest
          player (after Ray Reardon) to win a world title in snooker's modern era.
        </p>
        <p>
          A prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan is the only player to have achieved 1,000 career century breaks, a
          milestone he reached in the 2019 Players Championship final. He has also achieved the highest number of
          officially recognized maximum breaks in professional competition, with 15, and the fastest competitive maximum
          break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noted for his unpredictable temperament and outspoken views, O'Sullivan has often been at the centre of
          controversy in the sport. He has received many warnings and sanctions from snooker's governing body over his
          conduct and comments, and has frequently threatened to retire. Outside his playing career, he has worked as a
          pundit for Eurosport, has written crime novels and autobiographies, and has starred in the miniseries Ronnie
          O'Sullivan's American Hustle. He was awarded an OBE in the 2016 New Year Honours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Known for his fast and attacking style of play, O'Sullivan gained the nickname "The Rocket" after winning a
          best-of-nine frame match in a record 43 minutes during his debut season as a professional. A prolific
          breakbuilder and solid tactical player, he has stated his disdain for long, drawn-out games, saying that they
          harm the game of snooker. He is right-handed but can play to a high standard with his left hand and
          routinely alternates where needed, enabling him to attempt shots with his left hand that would otherwise
          require a rest or spider. When he first displayed this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship
          against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian accused him of disrespect and refused to shake hands after the match.
