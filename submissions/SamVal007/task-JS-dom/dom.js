      "Ronald Antonio O'Sullivan OBE (born 5 December 1975) is an English professional snooker player from Essex. As a six-time (and reigning) world champion, a record seven-time Masters champion, and a record seven-time UK champion, he is the most successful player in the history of snooker's Triple Crown Series, with a record 20 titles. He also holds the record for the most ranking titles in professional snooker, with 37. His career prize money of over £11.7 million is the most by any player in snooker history.",
      "A noted snooker prodigy from an early age, O'Sullivan made his first competitive century break at age 10, won the British Under-16 Championship at age 13, achieved his first competitive maximum break at age 15, and won the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship before turning professional in 1992, aged 16. He won his first ranking title at the 1993 UK Championship aged 17 born and 358 days, making him the youngest player ever to win a professional ranking event, a record he still holds. He is also the youngest player ever to win the Masters, which he first achieved in 1995, aged 19 born and 69 days. O'Sullivan is now also noted for his longevity in the sport, having competed in a record 28 consecutive World Championships at the Crucible between 1993 and 2020. Winning the 2020 World Championship aged 44 born and 254 days made him the second-oldest player (after Ray Reardon) to win a world title in snooker's modern era.",
      "A prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan is the only player to have achieved 1,000 career century breaks, a milestone he reached in the 2019 Players Championship final. He has also achieved the highest number of officially recognized maximum breaks in professional competition, with 15, and the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship.",
      "Noted for his unpredictable temperament and outspoken views, O'Sullivan has often been at the centre of controversy in the sport. He has received many warnings and sanctions from snooker's governing body over his conduct and comments, and has frequently threatened to retire. Outside his playing career, he has worked as a pundit for Eurosport, has written crime novels and autobiographies, and has starred in the miniseries Ronnie O'Sullivan's American Hustle. He was awarded an OBE in the 2016 New Year Honours.",
      "Known for his fast and attacking style of play, O'Sullivan gained the nickname The Rocket after winning a best-of-nine frame match in a record 43 minutes during his debut season as a professional. A prolific breakbuilder and solid tactical player, he has stated his disdain for long, drawn-out games, saying that they harm the game of snooker. He is right-handed but can play to a high standard with his left hand and routinely alternates where needed, enabling him to attempt shots with his left hand that would otherwise require a rest or spider.[37] When he first displayed this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian accused him of disrespect and refused to shake hands after the match."

      "Stephen Gordon Hendry MBE (born 13 January 1969) is a Scottish professional snooker player and a commentator for the BBC and ITV. As a seven-times World Champion, he is the most successful player in the modern era of the World Snooker Championship and holds the record for the most seasons as world number one (nine seasons). His first world title in 1990, at the age of 21, made him the youngest-ever World Champion, a record that he still holds",
      "Hendry also won six Masters titles (including five consecutively), and five UK Championship titles. His total of 18 Triple Crown tournament wins is surpassed only by Ronnie O'Sullivan's 20. One of only three players to have won all three Triple Crown events in a single season, Hendry is the only player to have achieved the feat twice, in the 1989–90 and 1995–96 seasons. He has the second-highest total of ranking titles (36) behind O'Sullivan. A prolific break builder, Hendry has recorded a total of 775 career century breaks, and made 11 officially recognised maximum breaks in professional competition.",
      "He was awarded an MBE in 1994, and voted BBC Scotland's Sports Personality of the Year in 1987 and 1996. In May 2012, after featuring in his 27th consecutive World Championship, he announced his retirement from the game, bringing to an end his record 23 consecutive seasons in the top 16 of the world rankings. Hendry’s retirement was in response to his game being severely impacted by ‘yips’, which first began 12 years prior to his retirement.",
      "In September 2020, it was announced that Hendry would come out of retirement after having been given an invitational tour card for the next two seasons."

Selby is also a pool player; he was the 2006 World Eight-ball Pool Federation champion and runner-up at the Chinese Eight-ball World Championship in 2015.",
      "Selby was born in Leicester, England, on 19 June 1983. He began playing pool at the age of eight and snooker aged nine.[4] Malcolm Thorne, the brother of Leicester-born snooker player Willie Thorne, spotted Selby's snooker ability and offered him free practice at his brother's snooker club, which Selby took full advantage of, practising in the evenings after school. When Selby was 16, his father David died of cancer. Two months later, Selby joined the main professional tour, having left school with no qualifications."

      "In terms of world titles in the modern era, Higgins is fifth behind Stephen Hendry (7), Steve Davis (6), Ray Reardon (6) and Ronnie O'Sullivan (6). His 30 career ranking titles puts him in third place behind Hendry (36) and O'Sullivan (37).

He has also compiled 11 competitive maximum breaks tied with Hendry (11), placing him second behind O'Sullivan (15). Higgins has been world number 1 on four occasions.",
      "In 2010, the News of the World tabloid newspaper carried out a sting operation in a hotel room in Ukraine, which claimed to show Higgins and his then-manager arranging to lose specific frames in future matches for money. Although an investigation cleared Higgins of match-fixing allegations, it found that he had brought the sport into disrepute by failing to report, and giving the impression of agreeing with, an invitation to breach the sport's betting rules. The WPBSA banned Higgins from professional competition for six months and fined him £75,000. He returned to the tour midway through the 2010–11 season.",
      "Higgins added a third UK Championship title in 2010 and claimed his fourth world title in 2011. He then experienced a slump in form, and between 2012 and 2014 only won the 2012 Shanghai Masters. He spoke frequently in this period about his struggles with confidence and consistency. However, in 2015, Higgins returned to winning ways, capturing three ranking titles. He reached three consecutive World Championship finals between 2017 and 2019, but lost to Mark Selby in 2017, to Mark Williams in 2018, and to Judd Trump in 2019."
