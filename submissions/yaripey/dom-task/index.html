      Adventure Time is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network.
      Produced by Frederator Studios and Cartoon Network Studios, the series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn
      (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio)â€”a dog with the magical
      power
      to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with
      Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), Marceline (Olivia Olson), BMO (Niki Yang), and
      others.
      The series is based on a 2007 short produced for Nicktoons and Frederator Studios' animation incubator series
      Random! Cartoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length
      series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010 and ended on
      September 3, 2018. \nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy role-playing
      game
      Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for episodes
      are
      decided by storyboarding artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months
      to
      complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group
      recordings,
      and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about
      eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced
      that
      on September 29, 2016, the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The series finale
      aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called Adventure Time: Distant Lands,
      were announced, which will air exclusively on HBO Max starting with two in 2020. \n Adventure Time has been a
      ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being
      aimed
      primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive
      reviews from critics and won awards, including eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, three Annie Awards,
      two
      British Academy Children's Awards, a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, and a Kerrang! Award. The series has also
      been nominated for three Critics' Choice Television Awards, two Annecy Festival Awards, a TCA Award, and a
      Sundance
      Film Festival Award, among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an Eisner
      Award and two Harvey Awards. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books,
      video games and clothing.
