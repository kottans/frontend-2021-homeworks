      "Adventure Time is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. Produced by Frederator Studios and Cartoon Network Studios, the series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio)—a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), Marceline (Olivia Olson), BMO (Niki Yang), and others. The series is based on a 2007 short produced for Nicktoons and Frederator Studios' animation incubator series Random! Cartoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010 and ended on September 3, 2018. The series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for episodes are decided by storyboarding artists based on rough outlines. ",
      "Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced that on September 29, 2016, the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The series finale aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called Adventure Time: Distant Lands, were announced, which will air exclusively on HBO Max starting with two in 2020. ",
      "Adventure Time has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, three Annie Awards, two British Academy Children's Awards, a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, and a Kerrang! Award. The series has also been nominated for three Critics' Choice Television Awards, two Annecy Festival Awards, a TCA Award, and a Sundance Film Festival Award, among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an Eisner Award and two Harvey Awards. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing."

      "Finn the Human (also known as Finn Mertens) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated television series Adventure Time created by Pendleton Ward. He is voiced by Jeremy Shada in most appearances. The character made his debut in the original pilot, where he was named Pen and voiced by Zack Shada, Jeremy's older brother.",
      "Finn debuted at age 12 but aged over the course of the show, and was 17 by the series finale. Finn sets off on magical random quests around the Land of Ooo. He would gladly fight or beat up anything evil, but would not harm anything good or \"neutral\". Having a strong moral code, Finn swore that he would help anyone in need and often performs heroic feats to save the day; however, Finn's enthusiastic nature becomes more toned down as the series progresses, suggesting he is both maturing and developing as a character as he ages. As shown in \"Memories of Boom Boom Mountain\", Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He had fallen onto a large leaf and lay there crying until Joshua and Margaret, Jake's parents, rescued him from the wilderness and took him in to raise him alongside Jake, who became like a brother to him. According to the episode \"The Vault\", Finn has had a number of past lives. In \"Red Starved\", it is revealed that Finn is color blind, believing that an emerald was a ruby.",
      "In the Season 6 premiere \"Escape From the Citadel\", Finn has lost half of his right arm, from which a flower protruded. He later regains his arm, now as a prosthetic, in the episode \"Breezy\", only to lose it again in the episode \"Reboot\" when his grass arm transforms itself into a humanoid, sentient being. In the following episode \"Two Swords\", Finn gets fitted with a new robotic arm, which can transform into many different weapons.\nFinn's ultimate fate is not revealed; however, the series finale \"Come Along With Me\" implies that the rabbit-like creature Shermy, who finds Finn's discarded prosthetic arm, is Finn's latest reincarnation. A fallen statue of Finn also appears in the episode's opening sequence, set in this future world."

      "Jake the Dog is a fictional character in the American animated television series Adventure Time created by Pendleton Ward. He can stretch, shrink, or mold any part of his body to any shape and almost any size, ranging from becoming gigantic to becoming incredibly small. He acts as a confident mentor to his energetic adopted brother Finn, though has a tendency to give somewhat questionable advice. Jake has a laid-back attitude in most situations, but loves adventure and will eagerly fight when he needs to. His powers help Finn considerably in combat and transportation, but are also sometimes used as nothing more than jovial forms of expression. He has a partner named Lady Rainicorn (voiced by Niki Yang); they have five children together as seen in \"Jake the Dad\". He is quite skilled at playing the viola, which houses a worm called Shelby.",
      "According to the series, Jake was conceived when his father, Joshua, was bitten by the shapeshifting extra-dimensional creature Warren Ampersand during a detective investigation with his wife Margaret, and was later born from a pustule on his father's head originating from the creature's bite. It is inferred that Jake's magical powers are a result of his biological relationship with Ampersand, though he is apparently unaware of the circumstances of his birth and instead believes his powers to be the result of having rolled around in a \"magical mud puddle\" as a pup. In one of the episodes that shows him as a pup, it shows that he had a best friend named Anna Spurrier that was a leaf bunny, but disappeared unexpectedly and was never seen again. After his birth, Jake was raised normally by Joshua and Margaret as their son, alongside their own biological son Jermaine and their adoptive human son Finn.",
      "Little has been shown in the series about Jake's subsequent childhood life with his family, though in his youth, he was known to be a successful criminal and the leader of his own gang, a position he later retired from to take part in a more respectable life as an adventurer with Finn.[4] Around this time, he also began a romantic relationship with Lady Rainicorn, with whom he has five children—daughters Charlie, Viola, and Jake Jr., and sons T.V. and Kim Kil Whan. The finale episode, \"Come Along With Me\", reveals that Jake's hybrid descendants will become the continent's dominant species in a thousand years."

      "Marceline the Vampire Queen is a fictional character in the American animated Cartoon Network television series Adventure Time, created by Pendleton Ward. She is voiced by Olivia Olson in most appearances, by Ava Acres as a child and by Cloris Leachman as an old woman. Marceline is a fun-loving 1,000-year-old vampire queen, as well as a musician who plays an electric bass that she made from her family's heirloom battle-axe. The artistic design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time.",
      "Marceline makes her debut in the first-season episode \"Evicted!\", in which she forces Finn and Jake from their home. However, as the series progresses, Marceline becomes a close friend to the two. Several backstory episodes have established that she was born to an unnamed human mother (voiced by Rebecca Sugar) and the demon Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Olivia's real-life father, Martin Olson).",
      "Furthermore, when she was a child, the cataclysmic Mushroom War occurred, and soon after she developed a father-daughter-like bond with Simon Petrikov (voiced by Tom Kenny), who would one day turn into the Ice King.",
      "Marceline has been critically acclaimed and is popular with the Adventure Time fandom. The character was also the focus of the seventh season miniseries Stakes (2015). Early in the show's history, Ward himself stated that Marceline was his favorite character because he did not know everything about her history and backstory, which he felt added a mysterious element to her character. Marceline's relationship with Princess Bubblegum created controversy when the episodes \"What Was Missing\" and \"Sky Witch\" implied that they had been in a relationship—a relationship that was confirmed in the series finale \"Come Along with Me\"."

      "Princess Bonnibel Bubblegum (also called Bonnie or PB, occasionally P-bubs), is a fictional character in the American animated television series Adventure Time, created by Pendleton Ward. She is voiced by Hynden Walch.Princess Bubblegum is a \"Gum Golem\", a being composed of both human and candy DNA, and rules the Candy Kingdom, which is inhabited by other \"Candy People\". She is good friends with the series' protagonists Finn the Human and Jake the Dog, first appearing with them in Ward's 2008 pilot.",
      "Bubblegum is typically very kind and compassionate, having a strong sense of justice, though she shows a dark side when provoked. She is highly intelligent, being responsible for the creation of the Candy People as well as various devices including a miniature time machine. She is fluent in German and Korean, using the latter language to communicate with her friend Lady Rainicorn. Bubblegum is skeptical of magic, refusing to acknowledge it as anything other than “scientific principles presented like mystical hoodoo”.",
      "Bubblegum is highly protective of the Candy People and cares deeply for their safety, but is secretly strained by the pressures of ruling and expresses a desire for freedom. Following a near-death experience at the end of the second season, she starts to isolate herself and becomes overprotective of the Candy People, even exhibiting authoritarian tendencies temporarily in the fifth season. At the end of the sixth season, Bubblegum is deposed as ruler following an election, where she realizes she has made the Candy People too unintelligent. Following the miniseries Stakes, Bubblegum is reinstated as ruler and becomes less overprotective."
