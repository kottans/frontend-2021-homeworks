Structurally, the work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material at the end.

A slightly revised version was later published by Fantasy Flight Games.<br>The board game was highly unusual when it was published, because it is a cooperative board game â€” each player plays a hobbit in the party, and the party will succeed or fail as a group to destroy the One Ring, thus winning or losing the game.",
