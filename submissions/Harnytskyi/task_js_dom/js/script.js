        about: "Loading Cat or Buffering Cat refers to an image macro of a calico cat expressing anger or confusion and a buffering icon superimposed over its forehead.

        title: "Ceiling cat",
        about: "Ceiling Cat is a photoshop meme based on a photograph of a cat peeking through a hole in the ceiling of a room. Its online popularity eventually led to several derivative characters, including his nemesis Basement Cat and Basement Horse. While the original photographer of the image is still unknown, several people have claimed to know its origin. Encyclopedia Dramatica states that the cat belongs to Wikipedia user Samguana but this claim has not been confirmed. In May 2012, Something Awful poster Quarex claimed that they were friends with the cat's owner, posting a similar photo of the cat from a different angle. The user also said the cat in the photo passed away in 2010.",

The earliest known usage of the Crying Cat was published by an anonymous Meme Generator user on June 11th, 2014 (shown below, left).
