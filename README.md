## Requirements
- no JavaScript, only HTML/CSS, use of preprocessors is allowed
- no external libraries or frameworks
browser support: Chrome only (feel free to use latest features)
- the popup is expected to have three states depending on user actions:
  - initial state: popup menu is not visible
  - upon click on popup-button button the popup menu gets visible or gets hidden if already open
  - click on "More" button adds 3 to 10 more icons and makes the content of the popup scrollable
- mobile view is irrelevant for this task
